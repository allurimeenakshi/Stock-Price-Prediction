# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
The **Stock Price Prediction** project aims to predict the future stock prices using historical data. Machine learning techniques, primarily **Linear Regression** and other algorithms, are applied to forecast stock prices. The model helps investors and analysts to make more informed decisions based on predicted market trends.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Model Selection**: Implements Linear Regression, and other machine learning models like Random Forest or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the models using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- **Prediction**: Predicts future stock prices for a specific date range.
